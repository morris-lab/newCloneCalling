# Overview
## Allowlisting plasmid library to obtain a list of allowed CellTag barcodes
CellTags constructs are made available as a lentiviral plasmid library. While the theoretical diversity of CellTags is very high (65,536 for the original tags and ~68 billion for the 18N libraries) the real barcode diversity in the plasmid library is limited due to bottlenecks during the process of synthesis, cloning etc. To identify CellTag barcodes present in the plasmid library, we perform an allowlisting step. The methodology for generating sequencing libraries for allowlisting is detailed in our paper [link]. The following text outlines the computational workflow for processing the sequencing data:

## Parsing single-cell bam files to obtain CellTag reads

## Processing CellTag reads to identify clones
